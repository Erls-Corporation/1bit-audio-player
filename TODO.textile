h1. Todo

Things to do.

h2. Improvements

* Remove duplication of <code>1bit.js</code> and <code>1bit.swf</code> in each distribution. (Some github symlink magic?)
* Add javascript tests for 1bit core
* Test browser support and publish supported platform list, add bugs for those unsupported
* Should detect presence of common JS libraries and defer to their methods where appropriate (DOM queries, class manipulation)

h2. Features

* Support being passed an array of DOM elements to apply 1bit players to. Allows users to use their own selecor rules in more advanced libraries.
* Add state management so only one instance of the player plays at once
* Create prototype HTML5 Audio version
